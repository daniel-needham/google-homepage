My first html/css project!

Definitely enjoyed putting into practice what I learnt from the FCC walkthrough. I think I may have made the task more complicated than it had to be by using a flexgrid, which was probably not needed for a simple webpage. 

Page should be scalable & all items have a hover element. Will move on to the next project!
